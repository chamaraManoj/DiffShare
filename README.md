# DiffShare
Official repository of the DiffShare paper. This code repository is still under maintenance. There are two main phases in this repo development. During the first phase, we update the repository including the codes and data used in the experiments in DiffShare development. We share the code base used for crypto dataset and this is the same code base used for other dataset with slight modifications to the features used. 


In the second phase, we provide generic workflow of DiffShare that can be used as a tool on given multivariate time-series data.
